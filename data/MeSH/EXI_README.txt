MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) is the US National Library of
Medicine's controlled vocabulary thesaurus. MeSH is the vocabulary 
used by MEDLINE/pubmed, the main medical bibliographic db. 

From http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/xmlmesh.html

Relevance to XML: 

MeSH forms the basis of a number of medical vocabularies in common
use, including Pubmed, the primary medical citation index. Therefore,
medical information communications would be facilitated by a faster
transfer rate, medical database extracts or ontologies using MeSH
would be more compact if using an efficient XML datastore.
