====================================================
EXi Contact: gwhite at stanford.edu, 1-Apr-2006

From  http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/ and
http://www.loc.gov/marc/:

	MARCXML is the US library of Congress' literal conversion of
	MARC to XML.

	The MARC formats are standards for the representation and
	communication of bibliographic and related information in
	machine-readable form.

	The Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC
	Standards Office is developing a framework for working with
	MARC data in a XML environment. This framework is intended to
	be flexible and extensible to allow users to work with MARC
	data in ways specific to their needs. The framework itself
	includes many components such as schemas, stylesheets, and
	software tools.

Relevance to XML: MARC is a major metadata description format, used in
the catalog systems of major libraries.

Main contact for test case provenance :
- Dick Miller, Stanford University. "I do not endorse MARCXML, as it
carries all the problems of MARC over to XML rather than taking
advantage of XML's features, but it may be suitable for your
purposes."
